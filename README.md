# Portfolio-Project-2

## Overview

For project #1, I created a simple game of Blackjack.

Once players come to the site, they are shown an alert with a tutorial. Then then hit deal to be dealt a set of cards where
the goal of the game is to be the first to 21 or have a bigger score than the dealer period.
